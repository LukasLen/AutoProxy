# AutoProxy ![AutoProxy Logo](source/iconON.png?raw=true "AutoProxy")

Automatically turns your proxy on or off based on the current WiFi-SSID. It has yet been tested on Windows 10 and works there perfectly.

## Getting Started

You can use Eclipse to directly open the project. However, you may want to use other IDEs, in this case copy the .java files into an existing project.

### Compiled Files

You can find the compiled files under /release.

## Usage

Put in the SSID of the WiFi-Network you want your proxy to be turned on and click on "Save". Then you can hide it (It will show up in the System Tray).
